# PoPM
Can a modded video game with crappy multiplayer support convey a flavor?

## Installation/Update

### IMPORTANT: Always run the game from the steam launcher, otherwise the game will break at start

### Windows (Automatic)
Download & Drag the `PoPM_Installer(Windows_x64).bat` from [releases](https://github.com/Jorgegzz/PoPM/releases) to the game's root folder (where `Pineapple on pizza.exe` is located). Then run `PoPM_Installer(Windows_x64).bat`.

**Note: If it is the first time install, you may run the game twice, so BepInEx (the mod loader) has a chance to configure itself.**

### Windows (Manual)
This mod uses [BepInEx Version 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/tree/v5-lts) here is the [tutorial](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) on installing it.

Once with BepInEx installed on the game, download `PoPM.dll` and `PoPM.pdb` from the [releases](https://github.com/Jorgegzz/PoPM/releases) and drag both files to `Pineapple on pizza\BepInEx\plugins`.

Now, [download Steamworks.NET Standalone](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET/releases/download/20.1.0/Steamworks.NET-Standalone_20.1.0.zip) and extract both`steam_api64.dll` & `Steamworks.NET.dll` from the `Windows-x64` folder.

Drag `steam_api64.dll` to the root folder (where `Pineapple on pizza.exe` is located) and Drag `Steamworks.NET.dll` to `Pineapple on pizza\BepInEx\plugins`.
